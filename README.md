#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The app made was used to calculate intial investimates over time. The application provided a user-friendly interface that
allowed for custom user-inputs to calculate and display their investimates overtime.

/3What did you do particularly well?
I think what I did particularly well was condensing my code in main and removing redundant code so everything was clear
and concise. Considering the inclusion of classes and functions, it was hard for me as a new programmer to not include everything
in main so I thought I did that well.

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
There are many things I could of done to enhance my code. I tried my best to reduce redundancy however if I sat down and took
more time I think I could of condensed it a little further. Another way I could of enhanced it would of been using 
C++ functions that I'm not familary with like printf, even though I used it I think there are other ways I could of condensed
my code if I knew all the in's and out's.


#Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I did find writing this challenging mainly due to my lack of knowledge of C++ and its difference in syntax I have been used to.
The resources I had availble were my textbook, peers, and looking through the vast knowledge on the internet. The best way
I overcame this challenge and all my coding challenges have been patience and re-reading material. There are so many ways to
program things and all it takes is the initiative and time to review how it works.

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
The biggest skill I picked up from this project is how to condense my code and make things more readable/efficent.
This was also a test to my patience on how to figure problems that aren't as easily noticeble, such as figuring out why 
system commands weren't working due to the OS I was currently using.

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This program is extremely commented out so it wouldn't be hard for someone else to pick it up. I also made sure I used the best
and most accurate naming conventions to keep things clear. The class I set-up also is scalable and if it needed to be restructured
it wouldn't be difficult.
